# rust-brainfuck version 1.2
Simple brainfuck interpreter and filereader written in Rust.

**Features**:
+ Interpreter: Take input from user and interpret it.
+ Filereader: Read files and give output, files have to be where your current directory is (e.g., /rust-brainfuck ) or it won't work!

Try writing your own brainfuck code in the interpreter, or use the filereader to execute the bf.txt that is also contained in this repo!
**Bugs**
+ 1: Can't handle large files
