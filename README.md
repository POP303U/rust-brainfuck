# rust-brainfuck
Simple brainfuck interpreter and filereader written in Rust.

**Features**:
+ Interpreter: Take input from user and interpret it.
+ Filereader: Read files and give output, files have to be in the root directory

**Bugs**
+ 1: Taking input is kinda wonky but it works
+ 2: You tell me!
