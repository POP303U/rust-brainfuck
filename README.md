# rust-brainfuck
Simple brainfuck interpreter and filereader written in Rust.

**Features**:
+ Interpreter: Take input from user and interpret it.
+ Filereader: Read files and give output, files have to be in the root directory

Try writing your own brainfuck code in the interpreter, or use the filereader to execute the bf.txt that is also contained in this repo!
**Bugs**
+ 1: Taking input is kinda wonky but it works
+ 2: You tell me!
